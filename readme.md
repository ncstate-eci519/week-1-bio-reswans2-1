## About Me
Hello there! I'm Rebecca. I'm in my second semester in the **Learning Design and Technology program** here at **NC State University!** I am currently working as a 5th grade teacher for [Winston-Salem Forsyth County Schools](wsfcs.k12.nc.us) at [Griffith Elementary School](wsfcs.k12.nc.us/griffithes), but hope to move into Instructional Design or work as an Instructional Technologist if I end up staying fully in education. I'm very passionate about technology in the classroom and in my life. In my _free_ time I enjoy stargazing with my binoculars and telescope, playing video games, reading, and I stream on [Twitch](twitch.tv/otterkaiju). I also love to collect _unique_ board and card games. I'm looking forward to the challenge of learning coding and programming this semester!
